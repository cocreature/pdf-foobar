# pdf-foobar

## What is this?

A webapp for selecting pages in a PDF and creating a new PDF
containing only the selected pages. The focus is on keyboard
interaction to make it easy to work with large PDFs. The primary
usecase is creating a PDF that doesn’t contain the overlays often
found in presentation slides.

## Can you really not come up with a better name?

No, I can’t.
